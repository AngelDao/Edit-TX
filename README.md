# Edit-TX: Ethereum Transaction Editor

This is a boiler plate for building out a tx editor for **Canceling** and **Speeding Up** a tx. Sometimes txs get stuck even with current wallet providers cancel and speed up features.

## Status

This is working on Kovan and only works with Private Key or Mnemonic wallet config and Infura Provider. It is using React.js and ethers.js.
